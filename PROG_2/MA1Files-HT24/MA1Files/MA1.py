Important notes: 
These examples are intended to practice RECURSIVE thinking. Thus, you may NOT 
use any loops nor built in functions like count, reverse, zip, math.pow etc. 

You may NOT use any global variables.

You can write code in the main function that demonstrates your solutions.
If you have testcode running at the top level (i.e. outside the main function)
you have to remove it before uploading your code into Studium!
Also remove all trace and debugging printouts!

You may not import any packages other than time and math and these may
only be used in the analysis of the fib function.

In the oral presentation you must be prepared to explain your code and make minor 
modifications.

We have used type hints in the code below (see 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).
Type hints serve as documatation and and doesn't affect the execution at all. 
If your Python doesn't allow type hints you should update to a more modern version!
